# Amazon Sales Dashboard – Rethinking Urban Sales Assumptions

![Amazon Sales Dashboard](/Amazon%20img.png)

## 📍 Introduction

We often assume that **bigger cities translate to bigger sales**, thanks to their dense populations, developed infrastructure, and purchasing power. This notion drives marketing strategies and inventory decisions across many industries.

But what if the data tells a different story?

This Power BI dashboard, built from Amazon sales data, uncovers an unexpected trend: **big cities don't always mean big sales**. Instead, regional preferences, consumer behavior, and cultural nuances play a much bigger role than we often credit.

## 🎯 Objective

This analysis aims to:
- Identify top-performing cities and states by total sales
- Understand how product categories influence regional buying behavior
- Observe sales patterns over time
- Uncover the relationship between urban size and product performance

## 🧭 Dashboard Features

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:
- A **product category selector** to filter insights
- A **status filter** to analyze delivery and order statuses
- KPIs like **Total Sales (20M)** and **Seller Count (25.3K)**
- Bar charts for **Sales by City** and **Sales by State**
- A line chart to visualize **Sales Trend Over Time**

These visuals offer both high-level summaries and detailed regional insights.


## 📊 Key Insights

### 🏙️ 1. The Urban Sales Myth
- **Bengaluru (3.1M)** and **Hyderabad (2.3M)** outperform **Mumbai (1.9M)** and **Delhi (2.3M)**.
- Smaller cities like **Chennai (1.4M)** and **Pune (1.3M)** are also competitive.

This contradicts the assumption that metro cities dominate e-commerce solely due to size.

### 🗺️ 2. State-Level Trends
- **Karnataka (4.5M)** and **Uttar Pradesh (3.7M)** top state sales, ahead of **Maharashtra (3.6M)**.
- States like **Telangana (2.8M)** and **Tamil Nadu (2.5M)** show strong performance.

This highlights the influence of regional product fit over economic scale.

## 🛍️ Product Relevance: A Cultural Lens

Product categories such as *blouses*, *sarees*, *dupattas*, and *ethnic dresses* dominate. These trends reflect:
- High demand for cultural attire in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions
- The importance of **product-market fit** over assumptions about urban tastes

## 📈 Time-Based Trends

The trend chart reveals spikes and dips in sales between **April and June 2022**, likely driven by:
- Regional festivals
- Campaigns or promotions
- Seasonal demand fluctuations


## 📦 Delivery & Fulfillment Filters

Delivery statuses like:
- *Shipped - Out for Delivery*
- *Shipped - Delivered to Buyer*
- *Returned*
- *Cancelled*

...can be filtered to identify operational challenges and optimize fulfillment strategies.



## 💡 Conclusion

This dashboard demonstrates that **bigger cities not always equals bigger sales**.

To truly drive results, businesses must:
- Understand regional consumer behavior
- Respect cultural preferences
- Target the right products to the right markets

Data like this empowers smarter, more localized decision-making.

## 📘 Recommendations

   Promote products where they resonate culturally and socially.
2. **Invest in regional seller support**  
   High-performing regions need strong logistical infrastructure.
3. **Plan using historical patterns**
